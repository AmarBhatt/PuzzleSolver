1. Explain how your common solver is able to work with both puzzles.

We used generics in Solver and Puzzle, that takes in the type of 
configuration we are using.


2. What was the type of configuration you used for each puzzle?

Clock used Integers, while Water used an ArrayList<Integer>.


3. Starting with the Puzzle interface from part 1, what were the major
changes and additions you had to make?

We had to make both the Puzzle Interface and Solver class able to
accept generic types.  We had to implement a predecessors hashmap
to achieve efficient memoization in Solver.


4. What problems, if any, did you encounter when re-designing your 
project from part 1?

We had issues implementing generics, however this was solved
using the JavaDocs.
